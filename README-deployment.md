3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
5. Click Save

### Step 4: Customize Your Portfolio
Open `index.html` and update these sections:

**Update Links (around line 300):**
```html
<a href="https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME" class="external-link" target="_blank">
    GitHub Portfolio
</a>
<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/YOUR-LINKEDIN" class="external-link" target="_blank">
    LinkedIn Profile
</a>
```

Replace the placeholder project descriptions with your actual work.

**Update Services (around line 200):**
Customize the service descriptions to match your skills.

### Step 5: Access Your Website
Your website will be live at: `https://your-username.github.io`

## Features Included
✅ Cyberpunk design with golden accents
✅ 3D Batman character that transforms to cat on scroll
✅ Smooth animations and scroll effects
✅ Mobile responsive design
✅ Contact section with direct email link
✅ Portfolio showcase sections
✅ Professional services display

## What Works on GitHub Pages
- All animations and scroll effects
- Character transformations
- Responsive design
- Contact form (opens email client)
- All visual effects and styling

## Note
Since GitHub Pages only hosts static files, the admin dashboard and database features from the original version won't work. The contact section now uses a direct email link that opens the user's email client to send you messages.

Your website is now ready for deployment and will work perfectly on GitHub Pages!
